# LeetCode Problems and Solutions
### This is a portfolio of my attempts at LeetCode algorithms.
- Each algorithm file will contain a description of the problem and a solution.
  - I will try to always include my thought process for solving the problem, and test cases to run when testing.
- When applicable, file names will contain the corresponding problem number for easy indexing and lookup on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/)
- Specific LeetCode courses or study plans — like Data Structures and Algorithms — will be separated into folders.

#### Thanks so much for stopping by!
